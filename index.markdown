The ISC2 Scotland Chapterâ€™s mission is to bring together a community of Scotland's Information Security Professionals and share knowledge on evolving security threats and drive innovation.

Scotland Chapter was founded in 2014 by Ewan McIntyre, [James Kwaan](https://linkedin.com/in/james-k-5201384){:target="\_blank"}, Neil Campbell and [Manish Shah](https://linkedin.com/in/manishcissp){:target="\_blank"} among others and was running successfully till 2019. In 2020, due to the pandemic, the chapter became defunct but since June '23, a couple of security professionals sat together and started talking with ISC2 to revive the chapter.
