Welcome to the ISC2 Scotland Chapter website!
Thank you for your interest in our Scotland Chapter.

The London Chapter was reborn in 2014; driven by the passion of our key officers, fueled by the tenacity to our cause and supported by you, our members.  We, the Officers, are here to serve you as best we can to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for all Scottish Security Professionals.

We are constantly looking for innovative and collaborative ways to give back to our members, through events, newsletters, initiatives and support networks; we welcome all opportunities to expand in this area. We also welcome the support of industry vendors, organizations and other membership bodies; be it in providing opportunities to take action on our initiatives through to hosting events for our members, please do get in touch!

Our key focus for the ISC2 Scotland Chapter is:

Continue to expand the chapter and expand our capability to give back to our members.
To build our initiatives, particularly around securtiy awareness, and address the challenges we face in our communities.
To expand the Chapter network across EMEA, support like-minded professionals across the region to found more Chapters and work closer together for the benefit of the security industry.
We have an extremely exciting period ahead of us, full of opportunities to make a real impact and drive change for the benefit of all; we would love to have you join us on the journey and we embrace any and all input you would like to have.

Thanks for reading
Yours sincerely

Manish Shah CISSP
